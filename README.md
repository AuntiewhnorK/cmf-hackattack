# Opportunity* - cmd+f Hackathon 2022 Project

Opportunity* -
“We catch all opportunities (like shooting stars)”

Vision - Create a constellation where all stars can shine

Mission - Connect minority students with STEM opportunities

Values - inclusivity, accessibility, inspiration, connection

## What does the * in Opportunity* mean?

Every person is a star in a connected constellation.
 
The star after opportunity is inspired by the inclusive identity marker of “women*” which includes all women-identifying individuals and gender minorities. It comes out of the ethos of including those that are all too often excluded. 

Systemically, those with minority identities (in gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, culture, disability, neurodiversity, and more) have lower access to opportunities, spaces, and communities. We want to change that. We believe in a future in which every star can shine brightly and be connected to a constellation of opportunities that are built for them.

## How to Run
1. Have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and make sure it is on Environment PATH ([For Windows](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/), [For Mac](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-the-path-variable-in-mac))
2. Clone repo into folder
3. Fulfill requirements from text file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Navigate to folder holding `src` and files inside terminal (Ex: `C:\Users\username\..\folder>`
6. Copy paste `python -m uvicorn src.main:app` into terminal and run.

## Project Status
This project has been submitted for the CMF 2022 Hackathon. Outside of this, I (Auntiewhnor) plan to try and complete the About page and connect the `university.csv` to the database.
